Task A: Example exercises on COUNT
1.In this example, suppose we want to count the number of records or rows of the “FilmLocations” table.

Problem:

Retrieve the number of rows from the “FilmLocations” table.

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FilmLocations;

2.In this example, now we want to count the number of locations of the films. But we also want to restrict the output resultset in such a way that 
we only retrieve the number of locations of the films written by a certain writer.

Problem:

Retrieve the number of locations of the films which are written by James Cameron.

SELECT TITLE, COUNT(*) AS TOTAL, LOCATIONS  
FROM FilmLocations
WHERE WRITER = 'James Cameron';

Task B: Practice exercises on COUNT
1.Problem:

Retrieve the number of locations of the films which are directed by Woody Allen.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS TOTAL, LOCATIONS, TITLE 
FROM FilmLocations
WHERE DIRECTOR = 'Woody Allen';

2.Problem:

Retrieve the number of films shot at Russian Hill.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS Number_of_films, TITLE 
FROM FilmLocations
WHERE LOCATIONS = 'Russian Hill';

3.Problem:

Retrieve the number of rows having a release year older than 1950 from the “FilmLocations” table.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS TOTAL, RELEASEYEAR, TITLE 
FROM FilmLocations
WHERE RELEASEYEAR < 1950;

Exercise 2: DISTINCT
Task A: Example exercises of DISTINCT

1. In this example, we want to retrieve the title of all films in the table in such a way that duplicates
will be discarded in the output resultset.

Problem:

Retrieve the name of all films without any repeated titles.

SELECT DISTINCT(TITLE)
FROM FILMLOCATIONS;

2.Problem:

Retrieve the number of release years of the films distinctly, produced by Warner Bros. Pictures.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(RELEASEYEAR)), TITLE 
FROM FILMLOCATIONS
WHERE PRODUCTIONCOMPANY = 'Warner Bros. Pictures';

Task B: Practice exercises on DISTINCT

1.Problem:

Retrieve the name of all unique films released in the 21st century and onwards, 
along with their release years.

SELECT DISTINCT(TITLE), RELEASEYEAR
FROM FILMLOCATIONS
WHERE RELEASEYEAR >= 2001;

2.Problem:

Retrieve the names of all the directors and their distinct films shot at City Hall.

SELECT DISTINCT(Title), DIRECTOR
FROM FILMLOCATIONS
WHERE LOCATIONS = 'City Hall';

3.Retrieve the number of distributors distinctly who distributed films acted by Clint Eastwood as 1st actor.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(DISTRIBUTOR))
FROM FILMLOCATIONS
WHERE ACTOR1 = 'Clint Eastwood';

Exercise 3: LIMIT
Task A: Example exercises of LIMIT

Problem:

Retrieve the first 25 rows from the “FilmLocations” table.

SELECT * FROM FilmLocations LIMIT 25;

2.Problem:

Retrieve the first 15 rows from the “FilmLocations” table starting from row 11.

'This LIMIT clause would return 3 records in the result set with an offset of 1. 
'What this means is that the SELECT statement would skip the first record that would normally be returned
' and instead return the second, third, and fourth records.

SELECT * FROM FILMLOCATION
WHERE LIMIT 15 OFFSET 10;

Task B: Practice exercises on LIMIT

1. Problem:

Retrieve the name of first 50 films distinctly.

SELECT DISTINCT(Title) FROM FILMLOCATIONS LIMIT 50;

2. Problem:

Retrieve first 10 film names distinctly released in 2015.

SELECT DISTINCT(Title) FROM FILMLOCATIONS 
WHERE RELEASEYEAR = '2015' LIMIT 10;

3. Problem:

Retrieve the next 3 film names distinctly after first 5 films released in 2015.

SELECT DISTINCT(TITLE) FROM FILMLOCATIONS
WHERE RELEASEYEAR = '2015' LIMIT 3 OFFSET 5;
