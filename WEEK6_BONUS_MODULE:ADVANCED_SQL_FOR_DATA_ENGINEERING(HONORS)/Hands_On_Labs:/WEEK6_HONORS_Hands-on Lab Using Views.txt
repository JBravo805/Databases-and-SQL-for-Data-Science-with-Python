--Exercise 1: Create a View
--create a view called EMPSALARY to display salary along 
--with some basic sensitive data of employees from the HR 
--database
create view EMPSALARY AS 
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, B_DATE, SEX, SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES;

SELECT * FROM EMPSALARY;
--Exercise 2: Update a View 
--It now seems that the EMPSALARY view we created in 
--exercise 1 doesn't contain enough salary information, 
--such as max/min salary and the job title of the employees.
--Let's update the EMPSALARY view

--combining two tables EMPLOYEES and JOBS so that we can 
--display our desired information from the HR database.

--including the columns JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY, MAX_SALARY 
--of the JOBS table as well as excluding the SALARY column 
--of the EMPLOYEES table.

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EMPSALARY AS 
SELECT EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, B_DATE, SEX, 
JOB_TITLE, MIN_SALARY, MAX_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES, JOBS 
WHERE EMPLOYEES.JOB_ID = JOBS.JOB_IDENT;

SELECT * FROM EMPSALARY;

--Exercise 3: Drop a View
DROP VIEW EMPSALARY;
